Steps to run this project:
1. Using Anaconda for this worked best for me
2. Downloading most of the dependencies through the IDE should work except for Tensorflow which probably needs
additional steps because of an object-detection model I think. (I could be wrong, I don't quite 
remember everything I did in setup anymore)
3. Follow this guide for anaconda installation https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
4. Run python app.py in cmd prompt in the project dir
